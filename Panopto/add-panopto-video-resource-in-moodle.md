# The Panopto Video resource

> To add a Panopto recording to your Moodle paper, you can:
>
> - Add a Panopto recording to the Moodle Panopto block, which is on the right hand side of most papers.
> - Embed or link to a recording in most sections of your Moodle paper using the Panopto video resource.
> - Add recordings via [the Panopto embed button](the-panopto-embed-button.md) of the Moodle text editor.

- add a link to your Moodle paper's Panopto folder.

1. Go to your Moodle paper and toggle on **Edit mode** at the top right of the page.
